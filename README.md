### Instructions

`preprocess_data.py` expects that there's a directory in the repo called `coronavirus-covid19-tweets`, which can be generated by opening up the zip from the kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/smid80/coronavirus-covid19-tweets.

From there, it creates train, test and small dataset pickles in the data directory. I only pushed the small pickle in there so that we could work with some data when creating the pipeline. Note that these pickles contains lists of "Tweet" objects, which are defined in `tweet.py`
